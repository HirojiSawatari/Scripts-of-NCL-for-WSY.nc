Scripts of NCL for WSY.nc
=========================
There are some NCL scripts for analyzing WSY.nc.
##Correlation coefficient field.ncl
This script can show space correlation coefficient field between two spatial data.
##Empirical Orthogonal Function.ncl
This script can show spatial modes and PC series from EOF and calculate correlation coefficient with another test.
##Space field subtraction.ncl
This script can subtract space field.
##Time series.ncl
This script can draw time series of four tests from CESM 1.0, including moving average,  sliding t test, correlation coefficient, etc.
##Trend.ncl
This script can draw spatial mode of trend in a period.
